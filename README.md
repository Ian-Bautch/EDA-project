### Abstract 
Anadromous fish, like sturgeons and salmonids are species of fish that swim downriver to the ocean to spawn. Their decline in population over the years has been attributed to a array of things such as predation, overfishing, and decline in water quality. For example, Chinook salmon in Cook Inlet, Alaska have been on the decline for over 20 years due to a wide range of human and environmental factors. In order to maintain chinook salmon populations, we need to understand how their populations have changed over time and the factors that have caused those changes. This project will focus on the return rates of chinook salmon and what components are influencing the decline of the largest species of pacific salmon. Alaska Fish and Game monitors four rivers in Cook Inlet for chinook salmon with the Ninilchik River being counted in two separate areas and the Kenai River being monitored for an early and late run return counts, deep creek, and anchor river being the other two. This dataset includes daily counts from May to the end of August with slight variations in time with multiple sonar systems in some rivers. Each river has different escapement goals, the number of fish allowed to escape the fishery and spawn, and varies on the potency of the run, i.e. the number of fish. By visualizing the potency of the different runs over time, we can generate hypotheses about the causes for the decline in population by human impacts along with changing environmental factors. With this, there is hope for the future of this ancient and beautiful Alaskan fish.  
#### Introduction 
- Alaska's Cook Inlet has seen a decline in Chinook Salmon numbers in recent years and is due to various complex issues with many contributing factors. Cook inlet is renowned for its vitality as a marine ecosystem for Alaska that historically held large numbers of King Salmon (Chinook Salmon).  

- This noticeable decrease in the amount of Chinook Salmon returning every year from the ocean to spawn in the freshwater rivers has raised concerns for conservationists, fisherman, and scientists alike which has promoted efforts to understand what is currently happening to these fish.  

- Complete survival of Chinook Salmon, an anadromous species of fish, occurs over the course of multiple life stages happening in different and distinctive habitats which rely on varying environmental conditions which can help to explain the difficulty of successfully managing this species (Greene et al., 2011).   

- Some of the main factors contributing to this decline are overfishing, predation, rising ocean temperatures, and varying river flows.  

- Significant salmon output is best correlated to rivers fed by glaciers downstream of lakes. Consistent summer water levels, increased water warmth, acceptable in-stream and riparian habitats, and steady coarse river-bed materials for spawning are some of the features that support high salmon productivity (Dorava and Milner., 2000).  

- Alaska Fish & Game account for the return number of Chinook Salmon in four rivers across the Cook Inlet and comparing these numbers to varying factors can help integrate habitat conservation, sustainable fisheries management, climate adaptation strategies, and collaborative research efforts through multifaceted approaches.
