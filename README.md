### Abstract 
Chinook salmon in Cook Inlet, Alaska have been on the decline for over 20 years due to a wide range of human and environmental factors such as overfishing, changes in water quality and predation, among others. This paper will focus on the return rates of chinook salmon and what components are influencing the decline of the largest species of pacific salmon. Alaska Fish and Game monitors four rivers in Cook Inlet for chinook salmon with the Ninilchik River being counted in two separate areas and the Kenai River being monitored for an early and late run return counts. Each river has different escapement goals and varies on the potency of the run. Through the use of cross analysis on the different runs, we can highlight the major causes for the decline in population by human impacts along with changing environmental factors. With this, there is hope for the future of this ancient and beautiful Alaskan fish.
